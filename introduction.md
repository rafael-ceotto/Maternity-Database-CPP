This is a maternity-management-database application that stores the name of the patients, their child and what hospital they would like to attend based on their income level.
The programming language used was c++ and the libraries used to manipulate this file were: <iostream>, <fstream>, <string>, <iomanip>, and <cmath>.
This application was developed as my first c++ and, although simple, it's the base for something else that I'm still working on and should be uploading as soon as possible.
Please, feel free to use this code as needed.
